    "# 1. Data Sourcing\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively address our research question — how undergraduate students at LSE might strategically select courses and degrees that offer relatively easier pathways to achieving high grades — we first need to acquire a range of publicly available data from LSE's online resources. This initial phase involves identifying relevant data sources, scraping and collecting data, exploring and cleaning said datasets from faulty and irrelevant information, as well as preparing and structuring the datasets for downstream processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data sourcing process was divided into collecting two core datasets: (1) degree programme data, including recommended modules and application statistics, and (2) grade distributions by module, obtained from 5-year departmental PDF reports. These datasets need to be collected through targeted web scraping and manual extraction methods, considering the limitations of unstructured or semi-structured web formats.\n",

Sorting through all 22 paginated result pages of the degree catalogue is achieved through extending the *Search-course* website's URL with it's page index and looping the link extraction through every results page.

Only links that correspond to undergraduate programme pages — identified by its URL pattern — are selected and converted into full URLs.

    "### 1.1.2. Degree data scraping - Function\n",
    "\n",
    "With the list of programme URLs collected in the previous step, the next step is to extract structured information from each individual degree page. To achieve this, we define a function called scrape_programme_data, which takes a single URL as input and returns a dictionary of the degree’s attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing the function, it was necessary to manually inspect several programme webpages and their underlying HTML structures using developer tools and by examining the parsed output from BeautifulSoup. This allowed us to locate where elements of interest are stored within the HTML tree and identify consistent CSS selectors or tags we could use to extract the relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The targeted elements are:\n",
    "* Degree name and department: Retrieved from the page’s *h1><span* heading.\n",
    "* Course structure per academic year: Modules are listed in div blocks identified by unique *#year-x* IDs. These were iterated over to capture the course codes year-by-year.\n",
    "* Entry requirements: A-level requirements are stored under a specific element with the ID *#alevels*, and typically follow a paragraph structure.\n",
    "* Application statistics: These appear as stylized bullet-point figures under the *\"Your Application\"* section and include number of applications, intake, and acceptance ratio.\n",
    "* Cost information: Undergraduate home fees are usually listed in a paragraph block under the fees section and were extracted using a regular expression to capture pound-amounts *(£)*. Due to inconsistencies in the storage of overseas fees for various degrees, we opted to exclude this information from our dataset.\n",
    "* Median graduate salary: If available, this is shown in the *\"Graduate Destinations\"* section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of each function call is a dictionary containing all scraped data points, which can be appended to a list or converted into a DataFrame for further cleaning and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note, since LSE webpages occasionally returned temporary server errors (status code 500) during scraping, we added a status code check at the start of the function to skip any pages that could not be successfully accessed. This ensures our scraping process remains robust and continues running without interruption.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Further important observation is, that while the module lists are meant to only include all mandatory set courses for each year, in reality at times they include optional courses that are still listed on a degree's website as official course recommendations. Due to major inconsistencies among the storage of such recommended course options on the various websites, we are forced to later manually update these lists to exclude such instances and truly only reflect set mandatory courses for each degree.*"

These statistics are published annually by each department at LSE in the form of PDF documents, which include a breakdown of student performance in each undergraduate module — typically showing distribution statistics and frequencies such as mean and median grades, as well as classified results (e.g., 1sts, 2:1s, etc.) for the last 5 years running.\n",

This ensures we can still extract and analyze the grade data programmatically.\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, we focus on parsing the actual Marksummary tables from each PDF. These tables contain statistical data such as mean, median, standard deviation of marks, as well as minimum and maximum marks and percentile values about student performance across individual courses and academic years. This data allows us to assess performance patterns across departments and over time and are the key part of our module-level analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach to Extraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "We extract the data by defining a function that uses a while loop to parse through each PDF line-by-line using an index variable i, looking for the start of tables marked by the consistent header string *'Year marks mean sd'*. Once the header is found, we:\n",
    "* store the column names and map them to their respective indices\n",
    "* check for a course code, often found a few lines below the table, formatted like *AB123:Marksummary*\n",
    "* loop through each row, parsing values and adding them to a structured list mark_data (if the row is complete and aligns with the header)\n",
    "* keep track of excluded rows in excluded_data, especially those that are either empty or misaligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup allows us to extract data even when PDFs contain multiple tables or have slightly inconsistent formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges Encountered and Fixes**\n",
    "\n",
    "One major issue we ran into was dealing with incomplete or misaligned table rows. These rows typically arise when the PDF text parser encounters blank cells in the original table—commonly seen when there are 0 values (e.g., 0 students received a fail grade). Unfortunately, when using pdfplumber (or any other PDF parser), these blank cells are not interpreted as 0, but instead are skipped altogether, causing the rest of the row to shift left, misaligning values with the headers and hence having the total number of entries in a row to fall short of the header length.\n",
    "\n",
    "This issue was especially common in the second table (called *'Gradesummary'*) that follows the Marksummary for each course, which contains the degree classification frequencies (e.g., # & % of students who got 1st, 2:1, 2:2, fail). Despite extensive attempts using both extensive online research and AI suggestions, we were not able to reliably parse this table due to the unpredictability of missing values and their impact on row structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we made the decision to exclude the second table from our dataset. While unfortunate — since classification frequencies offer valuable and arguably more interesting insight — this decision was necessary to maintain the integrity of our dataset. The Marksummary statistics, by contrast, are consistently populated (as statistical summaries like mean, median, and standard deviation always require numerical input) and hence were extracted successfully in most cases. Including only rows where the lenght of values matches the lenght of the header, fully ensures that our dataset is reliable and clean."
